 arrakis_struggle.012.t: "The Ways of the Sand"
 arrakis_struggle.012.desc: "Weeks pass in Sietch Tabr.

 arrakis_struggle.014.t: "Whispers of Lisan al-Gaib"
 arrakis_struggle.014.desc: "You notice it in the way the Fremen look at you—especially the old ones, the Sayyadinas. They whisper when they think you cannot hear. 'Lisan al-Gaib,' they say. 'The Voice from the Outer World.'\n\nYour mother catches your eye from across the sietch. She knows the truth—the Bene Gesserit planted these legends centuries ago, preparing the way. But does that make the prophecy false... or does it make you its fulfillment?"
 arrakis_struggle.014.a: "Perhaps I am what they say I am."
 arrakis_struggle.014.b: "This is Bene Gesserit manipulation, nothing more."

 # Harkonnen Patrol
 arrakis_struggle.015.t: "Harkonnen Patrol"
 arrakis_struggle.015.desc: "A Harkonnen ornithopter patrol passes overhead, its shadow racing across the dunes.

Now comes the true challenge—to rise among these people, to become the leader the prophecy demands."

 # Harkonnen Reprisal
 arrakis_struggle.100.t: "Harkonnen Reprisal"
 arrakis_struggle.100.desc: "Harkonnen troops have descended upon a Fremen settlement in brutal retaliation for recent raids. The screams of the dying echo across the sands. Women, children, the elderly—the Harkonnens make no distinction.\n\nWhen you arrive with your fedaykin, it is already over. The bodies lie in neat rows, water already stolen from them. This atrocity will not be forgotten."
 arrakis_struggle.100.a: "We must endure. Our time will come."

 arrakis_struggle.101.b.failure: "Sietch Lost"
 arrakis_struggle.101_success.desc: "The Harkonnens walked into our trap like blind men. The sietch's narrow passages became killing grounds. Not one enemy soldier escaped to report what they found.\n\nTheir water is ours now. Their weapons will arm more fedaykin."
 arrakis_struggle.101_success.a: "Their water belongs to the tribe."
 arrakis_struggle.101_failure.desc: "The battle was fierce, but there were too many. The sietch is lost—those who could not escape lie dead among the rocks they called home. Another wound that demands vengeance."

 # Water Shortage
 arrakis_struggle.102.t: "Water Shortage"
 arrakis_struggle.102.desc: "Our water reserves are dangerously low. The windtraps have not produced enough, and we lost water-brothers in the last raid.

 arrakis_struggle.102.a: "Implement strict rationing."
 arrakis_struggle.102.b: "Raid the Harkonnens for their water stores."

 arrakis_struggle.110.desc: "The time has come. Stilgar says you are ready—ready to attempt what makes a man truly Fremen. To ride Shai-Hulud, the great sandworm, the Maker.\n\nThe thumper beats its rhythm into the sand. The ground trembles. In the distance, a sandwave approaches—something massive moves beneath the dunes.\n\n'Remember,' Stilgar says, 'the hooks must open the leading edge of a ring segment. Then you ride, or you die.'"
 arrakis_struggle.110.a: "I will ride the maker."

 arrakis_struggle.111.t: "Fedaykin"
 arrakis_struggle.111.desc: "You have completed the final trials of the fedaykin—the death commandos of the Fremen. The training was brutal. Many did not survive. But you stand among the survivors, bearing the marks of your ordeals.\n\nYou know now how to kill silently, how to move unseen, how to turn any weapon into an extension of your will. You are death incarnate."
 arrakis_struggle.111.a: "I am fedaykin."

 # Caravan Raid
 arrakis_struggle.112.t: "Spice Caravan"
 arrakis_struggle.112.desc: "Scouts report a rich prize—a Harkonnen spice caravan making its way across the deep desert. Minimal guards, heavy cargo. The spice they carry could fund our resistance for months.\n\nBut caravans have been bait before. The Harkonnens grow desperate to crush us."
 arrakis_struggle.112.a: "I will lead this raid myself."
 arrakis_struggle.112.b: "Send the experienced raiders."

 # Growing Legend
 arrakis_struggle.113.t: "Muad'Dib"
 arrakis_struggle.113.desc: "They call you Muad'Dib now—the desert mouse, the one who teaches survival. Your name spreads from sietch to sietch like wildfire. Fremen who have never seen you speak of your deeds as though they witnessed them.\n\n'Muad'Dib,' they whisper. 'The Lisan al-Gaib rides with him. He has ridden the maker. He has killed Sardaukar in single combat.'\n\nSome of it is even true."
 arrakis_struggle.113.a: "I will become what they need me to be."
 arrakis_struggle.113.b: "I must remain grounded. Humility serves better than pride."

 # Successful Ambush
 arrakis_struggle.200.t: "Successful Ambush"
 arrakis_struggle.200.desc: "Our fedaykin struck a Harkonnen spice caravan in the deep desert. The enemy patrol was annihilated to the last man—we left no witnesses, only empty suits half-buried in the sand.\n\nTheir water is ours. Their weapons salvaged. Shai-Hulud provides."
 arrakis_struggle.200.a: "Their water belongs to the tribe now."

 # Spice Blow
 arrakis_struggle.201.t: "Spice Blow!"
 arrakis_struggle.201.desc: "The sand erupts in the distance—a massive spice blow! The pre-spice mass has burst through the surface, spreading melange across the dunes in quantities that could make a sietch rich for years.\n\nBut such wealth comes with danger. The blow will attract worms. It may also attract Harkonnen harvesters."

 # Shai-Hulud Comes
 arrakis_struggle.202.t: "Shai-Hulud Comes!"
 arrakis_struggle.202.desc: "The sand trembles. A great maker rises from the depths, drawn by the vibrations of our harvesting. There is no time to flee—some of our people are swallowed by the desert before they can reach safety.\n\nThe price of greed."
 arrakis_struggle.202.a: "We should have been more careful."

 # Mahdi Revealed
 arrakis_struggle.210.t: "The Mahdi"
 arrakis_struggle.210.desc: "The Fremen of a thousand sietches have seen the signs. They have heard the stories—of the offworlder who rides the makers like a native, who sees the future in his dreams, who commands the fedaykin with the voice of a prophet.\n\nStilgar raises his crysknife before the assembled tribes. 'This is he of whom it was written. The Lisan al-Gaib! The Mahdi has come!'\n\nTen thousand voices answer as one."

 arrakis_struggle.211.t: "Sardaukar"
 arrakis_struggle.211.desc: "The Emperor's Sardaukar—the legendary terror troops who have never known defeat—have engaged our forces in the deep desert. These are not soft Harkonnen conscripts. These are killers bred for war.\n\nBut your fedaykin are bred for something more. They are bred for Arrakis."

 arrakis_struggle.211.b: "Use the desert against them."

 # Sietches United
 arrakis_struggle.212.t: "United as One"
 arrakis_struggle.212.desc: "For the first time in generations, every sietch on Arrakis has pledged allegiance to a single leader. The ancient feuds are set aside. The blood debts forgiven. All of Fremen society moves as one organism, pointed like a crysknife at the heart of the Harkonnen occupation.\n\nThis is what the prophecy promised. This is what the Bene Gesserit prepared. An entire people, ready to die—or kill—at your command."
 arrakis_struggle.212.a: "Together, we are unstoppable."

 # Worm Army
 arrakis_struggle.213.t: "The Worm Army"
 arrakis_struggle.213.desc: "They come at your call—dozens of great makers, summoned by the synchronized thumpers of a hundred maker-riders. The ground itself trembles as they approach.\n\nNo army in human history has faced such a force. The worms care nothing for shields or lasguns. They know only the rhythm of the thumper and the will of those who ride them."
 arrakis_struggle.213.a: "Shai-Hulud rides with us."

 # Fortress Falls
 arrakis_struggle.214.t: "The Fortress Falls"
 arrakis_struggle.214.desc: "The Harkonnen fortress crumbles under the assault. Sandworms breach the walls while fedaykin pour through the gaps. The garrison fights with the desperation of the doomed—they know what the Fremen do to prisoners.\n\nBy dawn, the Harkonnen banner lies in the sand. Only Arrakeen remains."
 arrakis_struggle.214.a: "On to Arrakeen. This ends now."

The final battle approaches."
 arrakis_struggle.300.a: "Let him come."

 # Water of Life
 arrakis_struggle.301.t: "The Water of Life"
 arrakis_struggle.301.desc: "The Reverend Mothers offer you the Water of Life—the bile of a drowned sandworm, deadly poison to any male who drinks it. The Bene Gesserit have sought for generations to create a male who could survive this transformation.\n\nThe Kwisatz Haderach. The one who can be many places at once. The Shortening of the Way.\n\nNo man has ever survived. But you are not any man... are you?"
 arrakis_struggle.301.a: "I will drink."
 arrakis_struggle.301.b: "I am not ready."

 # Spice Agony
 arrakis_struggle.302.t: "The Spice Agony"
 arrakis_struggle.302.desc: "The poison courses through your veins like liquid fire. Your mind expands beyond the limits of time and space. You see the past—not just your own past, but the genetic memories of all your ancestors stretching back to the dawn of humanity.\n\nYou see the future—infinite branching paths of possibility, each decision splitting into a thousand more.\n\nYou must convert the poison... or die."
 arrakis_struggle.302.a: "I must survive."

 # Kwisatz Haderach Awakens
 arrakis_struggle.303.t: "The Kwisatz Haderach"
 arrakis_struggle.303.desc: "You have done what no man has done before. The Water of Life is converted. Your mind encompasses all that was, all that is, all that could be.\n\nYou see the Golden Path—the only future in which humanity survives. You see the jihad that will follow your victory, the billions who will die in your name. You see the terrible purpose that has shaped you from birth.\n\nYou are the Kwisatz Haderach. The universe will never be the same."
 arrakis_struggle.303.a: "I see the Golden Path."

 # Death by Agony
 arrakis_struggle.304.t: "The Agony Claims You"
 arrakis_struggle.304.desc: "The poison is too strong. Your mind, expanded to the very limits of human consciousness, cannot convert the Water of Life. The universe tilts and spins. Your ancestral memories scream in chorus.\n\nAs darkness claims you, you realize the prophecy was wrong. There will be no Kwisatz Haderach. Not today. Perhaps not ever."
 arrakis_struggle.304.a: "Darkness..."

 # Final Battle
 arrakis_struggle.400.t: "The Final Battle"
 arrakis_struggle.400.desc: "All sides have gathered their strength. The Harkonnens, the Sardaukar, the great houses of the Landsraad—all converge on Arrakeen under the Emperor's banner. Against them stand the united tribes of the Fremen and their sandworm cavalry.\n\nThe fate of Arrakis, of the spice, of the Known Universe itself, will be decided in the coming hours."
 arrakis_struggle.400.a: "History will be written in blood."

 # ===========================================
 # ENDING EVENTS
 # ===========================================

 # Fremen Victory
 arrakis_struggle.500.t: "Fremen Victory"
 arrakis_struggle.500.desc: "The Harkonnens are broken. The Sardaukar defeated. The Emperor himself kneels before the Kwisatz Haderach, offering his daughter's hand in marriage and the Imperial throne itself.\n\nArrakis belongs to the Fremen at last. A new era dawns.\n\nBut you have seen the future. You know what comes next—the jihad that will sweep across the galaxy in your name, claiming billions of lives. The terrible purpose cannot be stopped. It can only be endured."
 arrakis_struggle.500.a: "I am the Kwisatz Haderach. I am the Emperor."

 # Harkonnen Dominance
 arrakis_struggle.550.t: "Harkonnen Dominance"
 arrakis_struggle.550.desc: "The Fremen rebellion is crushed. Their sietches emptied, their warriors dead or scattered to the deepest desert. The Baron's laughter echoes across Arrakeen as the last resistance fighters are dragged before him.\n\nThe Harkonnens rule Arrakis absolutely now. The spice flows once more. The prophecy was false—or perhaps it merely waits for another generation.\n\nThere is no Mahdi. There is only the desert, and those who rule it."
 arrakis_struggle.550.a: "Arrakis is ours. Forever."

 # Imperial Intervention
 arrakis_struggle.560.t: "Imperial Intervention"
 arrakis_struggle.560.desc: "The Emperor raises his hand, and the battle pauses. Too many Sardaukar have fallen. Too much spice has been lost. The cost of total victory would be too high—for everyone.\n\n'Enough,' Shaddam declares. 'The Fremen will have their sietches and their desert. The Harkonnens will keep their fief, under closer Imperial oversight. But the spice must flow. That is all that matters.'\n\nIt is not victory. It is not defeat. It is survival—for now."
 arrakis_struggle.560.a: "We accept these terms... for now."
 arrakis_struggle.560.b: "Never! We fight on!"
